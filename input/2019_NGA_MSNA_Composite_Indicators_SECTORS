******************************************* protection_index ****************************************************

##Under the protection sector composite indicator, we will have 3 sub-components, the last 2 are straightforward
and do not entail a maximum score while the sum of all sub-indicators could reach. However, this is the case for
the first sub-component, protection_general_comp: although the sum of all sub-indicators could reach 9 points, the
maximum score for this sub-component is 8.##
